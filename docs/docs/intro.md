# Intro

**TUnit** is another testing framework for .NET.
It can be used for unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, you name it.

It provides you a skeleton framework to write, execute and assert tests, with little opinion on how your tests should be.

That means you get more control over your setup and style of tests.
